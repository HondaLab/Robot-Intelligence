Counter flow of self-driving particles which include insect herd behavior and 
human walking in crowded situations is a widespread phenomenon.
We found a interesting phenomena such as lane formation.
In this research, we have developed sensorimotor mapping robot which can avoid 
ocstacles using nonliner function(hyperbolic function) and we regard those 
robots as self-driving particle.

Then we did some counter moving experiments useing that robots with different course 
widths on  擬楕円course,and we also abserved the transition phenomenon from counter
flow to one direction flow.

At last,we measured the speed of robots,flow rate and the time of transit to 
one direction flow.
