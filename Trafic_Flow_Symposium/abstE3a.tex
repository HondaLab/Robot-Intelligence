In this research, in order to unriddle what kinds of intelligence they have in face-to-face moving of insects and humans, we developed wheeled robot which can avoid obstacles based on Raspberry Pi and we use hyperbolic tangent function to transform distance data which got by three laser sensors to of both sides of motors'power output. Then we have done some face-to-face moving experiments with different numbers'robots on ellipical course and we also measured the speed, flow rate and the time spent of robots change to the same direction.As the result,we observed that all robots tended to moving in the same direction(one direction flow)regardless of initial configuration.And we found that the time of become one direction flow increases with the increase of width and the flow rate increases first and decreases from 49.5cm.
