Counter flow of self-driving particles which include insect herd behavior and 
human walking in crowded situations is a widespread phenomenon.

In this study, we have developed sensorimotor-mapping robot which can avoid 
ocstacles using nonliner function (hyperbolic function) and we regard those 
robots as self-driving particle.

Then we have carried out experiments in which these robots start from a counter flow 
in some oval-course, and we found a transition phenomenon from counter
flow to one-direction flow.
We have measured the flow rate and the transition time to 
one-direction flow.
