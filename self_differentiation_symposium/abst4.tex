In previous research,we did some pseudo-ellipse course experiments of Face-to-Face movement with seasory motor mapping robots based on tanh function.
Then,we comfirmed the transference phenomenon from Face-to-Face movement to one-direction flow and measure the flow rate and time from start to one-direction flow.

In this paper, in order to shun one-direction flow, we made neural network model(input:960,middle:1000,output:2) which can analyse one-dimension image data and
did about five experiments of  neural network model and seasory motor mapping model in same course. 
From those experiments we know the robots can avoid obstacles smoothly and keep Face-to-Face movement for a long time successfuly.
Beside, we also proved the neural network model is better than seasory motor mapping model in robots flow rate, time of keep one-direction flow and turn around number through compare between two model.
